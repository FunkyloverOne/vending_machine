# Vending Machine

The vending machine, once a product is selected and the
appropriate amount of money (coins) is inserted, should return that product.

It should also return change (coins) if too much money is provided
or ask for more money (coins) if there is not enough (change should be printed
as coin * count).

Keep in mind that you need to manage the scenario where the item is out of stock
or the machine does not have enough change to return to the customer.

Available coins: 25c 50c 1$ 2$ 5$
